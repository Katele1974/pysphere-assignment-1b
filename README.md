Python Script to calculate voltage using Ohm's Law: Voltage, V = A * I
# This script calculates the voltage using Ohm's Law: V = I * R
current = float(input("Enter the current (in A): "))
resistance = float(input("Enter resistance (in Ohms): "))
Voltage = current * resistance
print("The voltage (in volts) is", Voltage, "V")
